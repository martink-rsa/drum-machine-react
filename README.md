## Project notes

Encountered difficulties rendering out the drum pads being activated which ended up in a delay in the audio playing. This was subsequently removed but saved as a backup file called `DrumMachineBUTTONHIGHLIGHTS.js.old` in the `DrumMachine` directory. I mostly put this down due to my lack of experience with the useEffect() hook which I've since done quite a fair amount of reading on.

I will be reattempting this project at a later stage once I have managed to find a better solution for handling the triggering of drum pads and adding classes temporarily to the drumpad, preferably without the use of a state.
